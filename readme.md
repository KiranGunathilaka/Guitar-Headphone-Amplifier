## Project Overview
**Echoverse** is a pocket-sized guitar headphone amplifier that doubles as a 10 W practice speaker amp.  
It runs either on dual 9 V batteries or a 12 V DC adapter and offers two independent gain ranges optimised for **headphones** and **small speakers**.

## Features
| Mode | Voltage Gain | Intended Load | Notes |
|------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Headphone | 2 Ã— â€“ 22 Ã— | 8 Î© headphones | Safety-limited to protect drivers |
| Speaker   | 1 Ã— â€“ 121 Ã— | 4 Î© / 8 Î© speakers | Push-pull class-AB stage |

* Dual-supply operation (Â±9 V batteries **or** +12 V adapter with inverting converter)  
* Low-noise **NE5532** front-end with two-stage class-AB power driver  
* SolidWorks-designed aluminium enclosure with intuitive front-panel controls  
* Fully validated in **Cadence PSpice** (transient, noise, THD) and hardware-bench tests

## System Architecture
![System Block Diagram](Images/block.jpg)

1. **Pre-Amp Buffer** â€“ fixed gain (headphone mode) / variable gain (speaker mode)  
2. **Variable Gain Stage** â€“ non-inverting op-amp  
3. **Class-AB Output** â€“ complementary BD139/BD140 pair  
4. **Power Management** â€“ battery selector & inverting buck-boost converter
